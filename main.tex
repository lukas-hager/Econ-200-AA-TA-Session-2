    Do you have questions about what you've read in the text or heard in lecture?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Invisible Hand}
    ``\textit{It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their [self-interest]. . . . he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.}" - Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Gains from Trade}
    To realize gains from trade, what conditions must be satisfied?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Law of Demand}
   The law of demand says that, when all else is held equal (when all other factors remain the same), quantity demanded rises as price falls.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All else held equal is sometimes written in Latin as \textit{ceteris paribus}
        \item What is the intuition for why this law is true in general?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item From the textbook: ``What happens when the price of something falls? First, the benefit that you get from purchasing it remains the same because the item itself is unchanged. But the opportunity cost has fallen: When the price goes down, you don’t have to give up as many other purchases in order to get the item. When benefits stay the same and opportunity cost goes down, this trade-off suddenly starts to look a lot better. When the trade-off between costs and benefits tips toward benefits, more people will want to buy the good."
        \end{itemize}
        \item Why is it important to hold everything else equal?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Shifts in Demand}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the difference between an ``increase in demand" and an ``increase in the quantity demanded"?
        \item What non-price factors contribute to demand?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Income
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Normal goods
                \item Inferior goods
            \end{itemize}
            \item Preferences
            \item Prices of other goods
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Substitutes
                \item Complements
            \end{itemize}
            \item Expectations of future price
            \item Number of consumers
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Quantity Demanded vs. Demand}
    Again, from the textbook:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We say that a change in one of the nonprice determinants of demand causes an ``increase in demand" or ``decrease in demand" -- that is, a shift of the entire demand curve.
        \item To distinguish this from movement along the demand curve, we say that a change in price causes an ``increase in the quantity demanded" or ``decrease in the quantity demanded".
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Supply Curves/Shifts in Supply}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Supply curve shows the \textit{willingness to sell} at each price
        \item Nonprice determinants of supply:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Prices of related goods
            \item Technology
            \item Prices of inputs
            \item Expectations
            \item Number of sellers
        \end{itemize}
        \item From the textbook: ``Just as with demand, changes in price cause suppliers to move to a different point on the same supply curve, while changes in the nonprice determinants of supply shift the supply curve itself. A change in a nonprice determinant increases or decreases \textit{supply}. A change in price increases or decreases the \textit{quantity supplied}."
    \end{itemize}

    Suppose France is currently producing 1 bottle of wine and 6 pounds of schnitzel, and Germany is currently producing 3 bottles of wine and 6 pounds of schnitzel. Demonstrate that France and Germany can both be better off if the specialize in producing only one good and then trade for the other. What are the gains from trade?

\begin{frame}[t]{Finding Equilibrium}
    The demand and supply equations for the market for oil changes in Seattle are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Demand: $Q=12000 - 100P$
        \item Supply: $Q=50P$
        \item $P$ = price per oil change, and $Q$ = quantity of oil changes per day
    \end{itemize}
    Calculate the equilibrium price and quantity.
